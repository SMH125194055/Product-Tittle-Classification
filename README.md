# 🏷️ Product Title Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on **multi-class product classification**, where the goal is to accurately predict the **product category** based on its **title**. The model learns from textual product titles and assigns them to the appropriate category using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

## 🚀 Features
- **Multi-class classification**: Predicts the category of a product based on its title.
- **Preprocessing pipeline**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
- **Model training & evaluation**: Uses machine learning models like **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Transformers**.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of product titles labeled with corresponding categories. The model learns from these examples and generalizes to new product titles.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖
- **NLTK & SpaCy** 🏗️


## 📊 Model Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, removing stopwords, stemming/lemmatization.
2. **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF, word embeddings, or deep learning representations.
3. **Model Training**: Different ML models are trained and evaluated.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model performance.
5. **Evaluation**: Using confusion matrix, accuracy, and F1-score.
6. **Prediction**: The final trained model classifies new product titles.

## 📈 Results
- Achieved **high accuracy** in classifying product titles.
- Compared multiple models to identify the best-performing approach.
- Applied **hyperparameter tuning** for optimal performance.
